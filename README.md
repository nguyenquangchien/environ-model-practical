Code and materials of the book "[Environmental Modelling: a Practical Introduction](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiijfiYprv1AhWLTcAKHctWCD4QFnoECAgQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.routledge.com%2FEnvironmental-Modeling-A-Practical-Introduction%2FBarnsley%2Fp%2Fbook%2F9780367389475&usg=AOvVaw2HXYtSBM26oacmY3r_JEtT)" by M.J. Barnsley, CRC Press (2007)

Dr Barnsley presented an excited introduction to environmental modelling using the somewhat lesser-known tools -- Awk and Gnuplot. However, he had proven that the tools are very suitable for processing various data types in environmental modelling: from time series to raster data. 

In this code repository, I add Python notebooks, trying to replicate the results of the original examples.
